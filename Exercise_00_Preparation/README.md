## Development Platform Preparation
Prior to start learning and hands-on, you have to make sure required tools below are ready:
1. **Hibiscus Sense**. If you don't own it yet, you are always welcome to purchase it from :shopping_cart: [Myduino](https://myduino.com/product/myd-036/)
2. USB Cable Type-A to Type-C, because Hibiscus Sense's USB port is Type-C.
2. **Arduino IDE**. Download it from it's official website [Arduino Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) page and install it on your PC.

3. [ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) hardware library. Below is screenshot, showing the `Arduino IDE Boards Manager` (Arduino IDE Menu: **_Tools > Board:"_________" > Boards Manager..._**) which already have esp32 hardware library `INSTALLED`. Follow this [instruction](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html#installing-using-arduino-ide) to Install using Arduino IDE.

## Connect Hibiscus Sense to Computer's USB Port
Connect the USB cable Type-C to Hibiscus Sense and Type-A to our computer. Hibiscus Sense comes with preset program to test on-board actuators and sensors. Should be by now we'll see the buzzer is buzzing, the RGB LED changing colors, the blue LED blinking and the reading of sensors at Serial Monitor (we have to open the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor to see the data). Suppose, you didn't see any reaction on the board you can contact Mr. Ariffin via [WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=60177875232&text=Hi%20Mr.%20Ariffin,%20please%20help.%20My%20Hibiscus%20Sense,%20seems%20not%20working%20for%20the%20first%20time.) for help.
