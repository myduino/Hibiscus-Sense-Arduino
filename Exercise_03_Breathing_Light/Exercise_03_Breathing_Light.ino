/*
 * Hibiscus Sense - Exercise 03 Breathing Light
 * 
 * There is 1x blue LED.
 * This LED is connected to GPIO2 of ESP32 microcontroller.
 * We need to generate PWM output signal on GPIO2 to control the brightness of this LED.
 * 
 * Therefore in the sketch,
 * we configure the PWM controller, choose GPIO for PWM signal output 
 * and generate the PWM signal on chosen GPIO.
