 * In Arduino ESP32 programming Serial library is used to program the UART controller
 * Main functions of Serial library are:
 * begin() function to initiate serial communication
 * print() function to transmit data
 * available() function to check if data is available in the receiving buffer
 * read() function to read data in receving buffer
