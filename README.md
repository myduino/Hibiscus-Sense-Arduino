## Introduction

[Hibiscus Sense](https://myduino.com/product/myd-036/) is a rapid Internet of Things (IoT) development board, powered by the mighty and popular dual-core [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) microcontroller, which on-board equipped with rich profusion sensor's data and basic actuators as below:
- 3 sensors:
  - **APDS9960**: an environment sensor, which sense *proximity, RGB* and *gesture*.
  - **BME280**: an environment sensor, which sense the *altitude, barometric pressure, humidity* and *temperature*.
  - **MPU6050**: 6-axis motion tracking sensor, which sense *3-axis gravitational acceleration, 3-axis rotational velocity* and *temperature*.
- 3 actuators:
  - **Buzzer**: short distance small buzzer.
  - **LED**: blue LED.
  - **RGB LED**: WS2812 RGB LED.

Hibiscus Sense comes with **USB Type-C** to power up the board and to program the ESP32. The on-board USB-to-Serial converter **Silicon Labs CP2104** with **automatic bootloader reset** circuit, we donâ€™t have to press the RESET button each time to upload the program.

Although, we can program ESP32 using other programming language such as C, C++, [Micropython](https://micropython.org/), [Rust](https://github.com/esp-rs/rust), or even with RTOS (Real Time Operating System)  [FreeRTOS](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/freertos.html). However, in this tutorial we will be using [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) as the learning and prototyping platform.

- **Blue LED** is connected to ESP32's `GPIO2`.
- **Small Buzzer** is connected to ESP32's `GPIO13`.
- **WS2812 RGB LED** is connected to ESP32's `GPIO16`.
- All GPIO can generate digital input/output (3.3V) and PWM signal output, except `GPIO34-GPIO39` because it is an input pin only.
- ESP32's `VSPI` is complete **MISO** `GPIO19`, **MOSI** `GPIO32`, **CLK** `GPIO18` and **CS** `GPIO5`.
- ESP32's `I2C` **SDA** `GPIO21` and **SCL** `GPIO22`, without pullup resistor.
- **Sensors**: **APDS9960**, **BME280** and **MPU6050** interfaced to the ESP32's `I2C`, respective I2C address: `0x39`, `0x77` and `0x68`.
- Avoid using `ADC2` channel while using WiFi.
- Each GPIO absolute maximum current drawn only 40mA.
- Board measurement including header in mm: 58.7 x 27 x 13.3 (length x width x height).
- Package measurement in mm: 71.8 x 35.5 x 20.4 (length x width x height).

## Learn How to Program Hibiscus Sense using Arduino

**Important Notice:** _The example sketch in the exercises below, is based on the latest Arduino ESP32 Core version 3.0.0. So, if you are experience user in Arduino ESP32, please update the core to the latest version, before you can use the following example sketch. You can get more information from the [Arduino ESP32 v2.x to v3.x Migration Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/migration_guides/2.x_to_3.0.html)_

You can clone or download this repo into your PC and open the exercise example sketch on the Arduino IDE. It is always recommended to begin with the hands-on learning preparation.
